1. Basic usage of org.knallgrau.utils.textcat library
---------------------------------------------------------

* first of all: add this jar to your application's classpath

Example Code:

   import org.knallgrau.utils.textcat.TextCategorizer;

   public class SimpleCategorizer {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
         String category = "please enter a command line argument.;
         TextCategorizer guesser = new TextCategorizer();
         if(args.length > 0) {
            category = guesser.categorize(args[0]);
         }
         System.out.println(category);
      }
   }

explanation:

this code shall demonstrate how to use the TextCategorizer class.it takes the
first command line argument and passes it to the categorize method of the
instantiated LanguageGuesser which then returns the recognized language as a
string object.


2. How to create your own FingerPrint files
---------------------------------------------------------

creating your own fingerprints can be useful for categorizing text into topics.
using the appropiate training data you could for example create fingerprints of
english texts about politics, sports, it or whatever you can think of. your training
data should be at least 20K in order to get useful fingerprints. you can either
create your fingerprints programmatically or by executing the java archive with
the "-createfp" option. let's take a look at the second option at first:

   java -jar textcat.jar -createfp politics.txt

by executing this command textcat.jar would look for a file named "politics.txt"
in its execution path and would use its content in order to create a new fingerprint
file named "politics.lm" in the execution path. you could optionally append a category
name to the command like that:

   java -jar textcat.jar -createfp politics.txt pol

in this case textcat.jar would create a fingerprint file named "pol.lm" instead of
"politics.lm".

let's see how to create fingerprints programmatically:

   import org.knallgrau.utils.textcat.FingerPrint;

   public class FingerPrintGenerator {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
         FingerPrint fp = new FingerPrint(args[0]);
         try {
            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(args[1]);
            fos.write(fp.toString().getBytes());
            fos.close();
         }
         catch(Exception e) {
         }
      }
   }

explanation:

this code takes the path to the textfile which is used for creating the fingerprint as
first argument and the path to the file to store the fingerprint as the second argument.
the essential part in this code is that the toString method of the FingerPrint returns
the fingerprint already formatted as a valid fingerprint file.


3. Using your own Fingerprints to categorize text
---------------------------------------------------------

once you've created your fingerprint files you need to create a config file which
maps category names to the appropiate fingerprint files. supposed you've got three
fingerprint files politics.lm, sports.lm and it.lm your config file (myconf.conf) might
look something like this:

   fingerprints/politics.lm		politics
   fingerprints/sports.lm		sports
   fingerprints/it.lm			information-technology

the paths to the fingerprint files are relative to the execution path of your application.
you can certainly declare absolute filepaths too.

in order to make your TextCategorizer use your configuration file you've got to call
the setConfFile method like in the following code:

   import org.knallgrau.utils.textcat.LanguageGuesser;

   public class SimpleCategorizer {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
         String category = "please enter a command line argument.;
         TextCategorizer guesser = new TextCategorizer();
         guesser.setConfFile("myconf.conf");
         if(args.length > 0) {
            category = guesser.categorize(args[0]);
         }
         System.out.println(category);
      }
   }

explanation:

this small program takes the first command line argument and categorizes it by
using our configuration file above. so the output of this program will be either
"politics", "sports" or "information-technology". if you want the LanguageGuesser
to fall back to its intern language classfication you've got to call:

   guesser.setConfFile(null);
